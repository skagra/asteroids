# Asteroids

A clone of the classic Asteroids arcade game using modern development tools.

Having recently written a version of the original Taito Space Invaders in raw Z80 machine code for the ZX Spectrum [here](https://github.com/skagra/space-invaders), 
I thought it would be interesting to recreate a classic arcade game using modern developments tools - in this case [Unity](https://unity.com/).

Core goals are:

* To learn Unity - I am totally new to Unity (though at least I have a good deal of experience with C#, which is used as the Unity scripting language).
* To accurately reproduce the game play experience of the orginal arcade machine, in look and feel.
* To attempt to mimic the vector display characteristics of the original arcade machine.

# Status

This project is at a very early phase!  All I really have is the ship at this point.
