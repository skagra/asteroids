# Asteroids

A clone of the classic Asteroids arcade game using modern development tools.

Having recently written a version of the original Taito Space Invaders in raw Z80 machine code for the ZX Spectrum [here](https://github.com/skagra/space-invaders), 
I thought it would be interesting to recreate a classic arcade game using modern developments tools - in this case [Unity](https://unity.com/).
